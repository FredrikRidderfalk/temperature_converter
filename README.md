- [x] Bookmark any links by input, and can also with a single click save the link for the current tab in focus.
- [x] Reset the stored list of links.

## My process

- I maintained high contrast ratios (13.1:1, 7.74:1) throughout the website, passing all WCAG tests. Tested using [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=000000&bcolor=16DFBD).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- How to build a full stack project.
- How to deploy an extension to the Chrome browser.
- How to create and interact with a database.
- How to create a tooltip that appears in the correct position on :hover.

### Continued development

I want to spend more time learning about accessibility and implementing additional measures for an inclusive experience. I look forward to refining my knowledge around positioning objects using the 'position' property.
